The goal of this lesson is to show how straightforward writing a paper should
be in the 21^st^ century. We will go through the basics of Markdown, the way
to use references, tables, and figures, how to automatically generate an
up-to-date PDF, and see a few solutions to emulate track changes using Git and
[CriticMarkup][cm].
