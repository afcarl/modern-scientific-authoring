The goal of this lesson is to show how *easy* writing a paper should be in the
21^st^ century. We will go through the basics of `markdown`, the way to use
references, how to automatically generate an up-to-date PDF, and see a few
solutions to emulate track changes using `git` and [CriticMarkup][cm].

> Learners should have completed introductory lessons on:

Almost all text editors can be configured as a productive markdown-writing
system. *RStudio* has a markdown mode. *Atom*, *vim*, and *Sublime Text* have
very extensive markdown support, including auto-completion of bibliography
through plugins.
