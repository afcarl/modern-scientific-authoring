The goal of this lesson is to show how *straightforward* writing a paper should
be in the 21^st^ century. We will go through the basics of `markdown`, the way
to use references, tables, and figures, how to automatically generate an
up-to-date PDF, and see a few solutions to emulate track changes using `git` and
[CriticMarkup][cm].

Almost all text editors can be configured as a productive markdown-writing
system. *RStudio* has a markdown mode. *Atom*, *vim*, and *Sublime Text* have
very extensive markdown support, including auto-completion of bibliography
through plugins.
